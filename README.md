# creative cat battle
 A TCG made by artists from the Sysina's Creative Corner discord server
 Inspired by the art of Alice we wanted to put our creative energy together and develop a small game using her art as a base. The scope of this project is minimal and we expect it to grow as we contribute more to it. There is no pressure, just come with what you have, and let’s make something cool and fun

# Concept and mechanics
The concept is a simple duel system to bring the opponent's health point(HP) to 0. Contrary to Hearthstone, the cards don’t stay in the field, after being activated they all go to the graveyard. The cards are grades with Star Level (SL) and consume Star Energy (SE) to be activated. There is also a random system (either a dice or a coin flip). The SE will follow the same mechanic as in Hearthstone with every player recovering their SE at each turn and increasing the max SE. The SE can only be increased to 10 after the 10th turn, the SE doesn’t increase anymore.
The cards will be classed as normal, super, elite, pro, and special corresponding to their SL (1-5)
Multiplayer is considered but is very low in priority 
Attack power(AP) Defense power(DP)
